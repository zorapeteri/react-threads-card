# Introduction

## Installation

```bash
npm i react-threads-card
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-threads-card
```

## Importing

```ts
import ThreadsCard from 'react-threads-card';
import 'react-threads-card/style.css';
```

## Basic setup

Here's how to set up a card with basic information:

```jsx live
<ThreadsCard
  author={{
    username: 'angeline_nieves',
    image: 'img/angelina_nieves.jpg',
    verified: false, // optional, but try setting it to true!
  }}
  text="every cat is a little celebrity to me"
  time={new Date('2024/05/05 18:43Z')}
  engagement={{
    likes: 1155,
    reposts: 258,
    replies: 13,
  }}
  permalink="https://www.threads.net/@angelina_nieves/post/C6mHlnfO3Dv" // optional
/>
```

## Adding images

You can add images to a post by using the `images` prop. You have to pass in an array of objects that have a `src` property with the URL to your images.
A maximum of 4 images is allowed within a post.

```jsx live
<ThreadsCard
  author={{
    username: 'samreich',
    image: 'img/samreich.jpg',
    verified: true,
  }}
  text="that's a wrap on game changer season 7"
  images={[
    { src: 'img/season7.jpg' },
    { src: 'img/season7.jpg' },
    { src: 'img/season7.jpg' },
  ]}
  time={new Date('2024/11/14 17:01Z')}
  engagement={{
    likes: 3900,
    reposts: 55,
    replies: 92,
  }}
  permalink="https://www.threads.net/@samreich/post/DCXAMJxTPOO"
/>
```

## Server-side rendering

React Threads Card can only be rendered on the client side as it loads its CSS directly into the DOM. To make it work with SSR, try importing the package dynamically.
